# Project: Typeahead and Infinite Scroll with Custom Local Database

# TASK-2 (FE) and TASK-3 (BE) are interlinked

## Overview

TASK-2 (Front End) is linked with TASK-3 (Simulated database). This project implements a Typeahead search feature with infinite scrolling, leveraging a custom local database solution built using vanilla JavaScript. The typeahead data is fetched from the local database, which does not rely on any external database tools or libraries.
